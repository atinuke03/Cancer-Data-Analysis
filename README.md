# Project Title: Cancer-Data-Analysis
# Project Overview
This repository presents an analysis of cancer-related data, focusing on identifying trends, treatment outcomes, and recurrence patterns. The aim is to enhance understanding of cancer progression and outcomes, contributing to improved strategies for patient care and treatment planning, while leveraging on PowerBI.the project provides visualizations and insights to support data-driven healthcare decisions.

## Insights uncovered 
### Result 
The result demonstrates that:
Cancer is prevalent across different cancer types. 
- Majority (Male-3697, Female-3790,) of cancer cases was reported among patients over 60 years of age.
- The highest number (753) of patients who reported skin cancer are in Stage IV
- The highest number (766) of patients who reported Leukemia are in stage I 
- The highest number (754) of patients who reported Lung cancer are in stage III
- The highest number (790) of patients who reported Breast cancer are in stage I
- The highest number (767) of patients who reported Prostate cancer are in stage II
- The highest number (767) of patients who reported Colon cancer are in stage II 
- 25.4% of patients had surgery as treatment type.
- 5793 patients had complete remission, 5942 had no response and 5951 had partial remission across genetic marker.

### Recommendation
it is recommended that: 
- Public health campaigns and screening efforts should be focused on various cancer types in the North, South, east and West respectively. This will prevent cancer development to advanced stages.
- Effective and efficient treatment for specific cancer should be optimized.
- Smoking status might correlate with more advanced cancer stages or worse outcomes. However, lifestyle intervention programs to reduce risk factors associated with poor cancer outcomes should be implemented.
- Certain genetic markers might be associated with higher recurrence rates or treatment resistance. Therefore, genetic testing incorporation into routine diagnosis and treatment planning should be considered.
- Early detection programs to catch cancers at smaller, more treatable stages should be promoted.
